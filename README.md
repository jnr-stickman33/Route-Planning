# Route-Planning
 Route Planning Project  This is a Route Planning project for Udacity C++ Nanodegree. This Route Planner uses A* algorithm to find the shortest path. It uses OpenStreet Map data for and io2d rendering library to display the route on a map. Instructions for each exercise can be found in the `instructions` directory, and unit tests for some exercises in the `test` directory.
